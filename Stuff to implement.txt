Tell me which of these you want prioritized next:
A — Full local same-machine two-player (one window, two control schemes) with user-configurable fire keys.
B — Responsive / fullscreen scaling so the map fills the browser window while keeping input mapping correct.
C — Improve bots: add simple AI (move toward nearest human and occasionally throw).
D — Any UI polish you'd like on the home screen (styling, nicer selectors, name for each local player).
Immediate next steps I can take (pick one or more)

If you want A: I'll implement multiple sockets from one client, wire WASD+Space for player1 and ArrowKeys+Enter for player2 by default, and add UI to pick keys.
If you want B: I'll implement a camera (scale + translate) and map mouse coordinates correctly to world coords—this will also make the canvas effectively full-screen while keeping the internal MAP_WIDTH/MAP_HEIGHT.
If you want C: I'll add a simple server AI for bots (move/throw).
If you want D: I'll style the home modal/inputs.
Quick verification checklist I will run after your OK and logs:

Start frontend dev server — check for module errors (PASS/FAIL).
Start backend dev server — check for startup message (PASS/FAIL).
Open game in browser — verify canvas loads, left-click fires, players cannot walk through obstacles (manual test).
If bots chosen — verify bots appear in player list after Start.
If you want me to implement local 2-player next, say "Do A" (or "A then B" etc.). If you paste the fresh dev-server logs I can confirm the build errors are gone and continue immediately.


If the dev servers start cleanly, I can:
A — Implement local 2-player on same screen (two sockets + separate controls).
B — Add bot AI (move & shoot randomly/target nearest player).
C — Implement responsive/fullscreen scaling and correct mouse->world mapping.
D — Polish home screen UI.


When playing against bots, when I kill one bot, the game ends, but I want when all the bots or player is dead then the game end and player or bots wins. Also, I want the game to supports two real players against the bots.


I need option to return back to the main screen.
